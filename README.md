## 🚀 About This Portfolio

This isn't your typical portfolio website! I've created a unique collaborative workspace experience where you can:

- 🖱️ Drag and arrange cards on a digital canvas
- 🔍 Explore different aspects of my professional journey
- 🌓 Toggle between dark and light modes
- ✉️ Contact me directly through an integrated form
- 🎯 Experience smooth animations and transitions

Think of it as a playful reflection of how I approach development: innovative, detail-oriented, and with a focus on user experience!

## 🛠️ Built With My Favorite Tech Stack

- 🎬 **Framer Motion** & **GSAP** - For those satisfying animations
